    "1. Key Features of Python that Make It a Popular Choice for Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a versatile, high-level programming language that has become one of the most popular choices for developers. Some of its key features include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Easy to Learn and Use: Python’s syntax is simple and easy to understand, making it beginner-friendly. The code is close to human-readable English, which reduces the complexity of programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Interpreted Language: Python is an interpreted language, meaning that code is executed line by line. This makes debugging easier and allows for rapid development.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Cross-Platform: Python is platform-independent, meaning code written in Python can run on any operating system (Windows, Linux, macOS) without requiring modifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Rich Standard Library: Python has an extensive standard library that includes modules for file I/O, regular expressions, networking, databases, and more, reducing the need to write additional code.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Dynamic Typing: Variables in Python do not require explicit declaration of types, making the language more flexible and easier to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Object-Oriented: Python supports object-oriented programming (OOP), which allows for easier code organization, inheritance, and modularity.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Community Support: Python has a large and active community, offering numerous libraries, frameworks (e.g., Django, Flask), and tools that simplify development."

    "2. Role of Predefined Keywords in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, predefined keywords are reserved words that have special meanings and cannot be used as identifiers (such as variable or function names). These keywords are part of Python’s syntax and help define the structure of the language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of Predefined Keywords in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "* if: Used for conditional statements.\n",
    "* else: Defines an alternate block of code in conditional statements.\n",
    "* for: Used to create a loop that iterates over a sequence.\n",
    "* while: Starts a loop that runs as long as a condition is true.\n",
    "* def: Used to define a function.\n",
    "* class: Used to define a class.\n",
    "* return: Exits a function and returns a value.\n",
    "* import: Allows the importing of modules."
